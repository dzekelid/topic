description: Cloud Pub/Sub is a fully-managed real-time messaging service that allows
  you to send and receive messages between independent applications. You can leverage
  Cloud Pub/Sub&rsquo;s flexibility to decouple systems and components hosted on Google
  Cloud Platform or elsewhere on the Internet. By building on the same technology
  Google uses, Cloud Pub/Sub is designed to provide &ldquo;at least once&rdquo; delivery
  at low latency with on-demand scalability to 1 million messages per second (and
  beyond).
